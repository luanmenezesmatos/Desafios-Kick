            <h2>HISTORY OF THE PASSION FOR JEWELRY THROUGH THREE GENERATIONS</h2>
            <p>
              In 1924 with great passion and skill, Enrico Grassi Damiani began designing and producing diamond jewelry so beautiful and elegant that his fame as a master goldsmith was soon established. Tiny works of art so impressive, that noble families entrusted him with the prestigious role of personal jeweller. His son, Damiano Grassi Damiani, continued the family tradition with great creativity and strong business spirit, focusing on design and promoting technical innovations. The Damiani family in its third generation is still looking at the future with passion, creativity and commitment. Today, Damiani enjoys success all over the world as Italyâ€™s leading luxury jewelry brand respecting the highhest artisan traditions and elegance of the Made in Italy in Italy style.
